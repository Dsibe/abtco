Online School "ABTco-Trading School”
Trading for beginners. Basic knowledge. 
<p>
This course is for everybody who would like to understand how the New York and London stock exchanges work, the largest and most popular in the whole world. 
<p>
For years, many people mistakenly think that only a young and very fast person can trade on the stock exchange - this is a false opinion. EVERYONE can try to trade in the stock market, regardless of age or gender. I am sure that you will find that out for yourself soon. 
I have a “student” who turned 79 this year, she is fine, she has an excellent portfolio of shares and her Facebook status is “FREEDOM!”.
<p>
Personally, it seems to me that trading is very similar to fishing, where you spend many hours watching and waiting for big fish :). But, as in fishing, waiting and patience are always rewarded!
<p>
Well, let's start!
First, a little about me: my name is Alex, 
I am the owner and founder of the online school "ABTco-Trading School", and the author of these lessons. I have been trading on the New York and London stock exchanges for about ten years and I spent several thousand hours watching the behavior of stocks in real-time (and, of course, making money). 
<p>
All the practical advice and recommendations that you will receive in these lessons are all the result of MY PERSONAL years of experience. 
Most likely, you have a question, why am I doing this? An absolutely logical question, by the way, if you are a good trader, you make money, and you have the experience, why should you spend your time on these lessons?
<p>
I can answer: a long time ago, I was at the beginning of the way, I was reading many books about finance and trading, then I made many mistakes during practice, then lost money because of mistakes, then collected knowledge again, returned to practice, made mistakes again (nobody is perfect, right?)…
So, almost all the time, in the intervals between making mistakes and losing money, I asked myself: why??? Why has no one told me this?! If I knew it… If I was warned… I would of course do… And so on and so forth :)
So, now, I decided to become a person who will explain, teach, share and warn!
<p>
And yes, I love to teach, and I am ready to do this for everyone, and especially for people aged 50+ for symbolic money, which only covers part of the school's administrative expenses. 
<p>
I have the knowledge and a great team, and we are ready to share with you our experience and help you to get the most interesting and independent profession in the world - TRADER. 
It is worth noting that I worked in different areas of business from the 1990s and personally understood for myself that none of the other businesses can give you as much pleasure and profit as His Majesty, Stock Market. Perhaps that is why all traders in the world respect it. 
I recommend all my students not to be afraid, at least let's try not to be afraid. Open a small account with a trusted broker and begin to move towards your freedom by small steps. This is one of the first secrets or experiences (whatever you want to call it), is that the deposit must be really small, start with two-three thousand dollars. All these small steps and a small account is the beginning for a successful trader. 
<p>
I suggest you stop being dependent on salaries and learn how to make some extra money and get to the next level of freedom. We all know that no one except us will take care of us, especially for people over 50, because for the system we are “small and unnecessary screws”. 
<p>
We will be very grateful if you invite your friends and family members to join us and help us accomplish our mission!!!
<p>
I am sure you will become a successful trader! A little knowledge and patience!
Well and good luck!
Lesson 1. How it works. 
<p>
STOCK MARKETS. 
<p>
There are three main stock exchanges in the USA:
<p>
NYSE - New York Stock Exchange
NASDAQ - National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations
AMEX - American Stock Exchange
<p>
NYSE - New York Stock Exchange - the oldest and largest US stock exchange. It is located on Wall Street in the old part of New York. 
<p>
NASDAQ - Founded in 1971. The NASDAQ is a fully automated electronic stock trading system. 
<p>
AMEX - The third-largest US stock exchange. Founded in 1921. It accounts for 10% of total stock trading in America. Located near the NYSE. 
<p>
In England, a major stock exchange is LSE, one of the oldest in the world. 
LSE stock exchange was founded in 1801 and today is the most multinational in the world. 
More than fifty percent of international stock trades on the London Stock Exchange. 
LSE is one of the most interesting platforms for trading because, for some financial instruments (we will talk about this later), the LSE stock exchange asks only 10% of their price!
<p>
To start trading on the NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX & LSE, besides the desire, you will need:
- for the beginning, one computer, and then it is better to have two or three computers (or two-three laptops, as in the picture below) with a processor of at least 2 GHz; 4 or more cores, RAM from 4GB. All the above can be replaced by a laptop;
- The next thing is a very important point. A good, uninterrupted internet connection (the most important thing here is an uninterrupted connection, this is very important);
- a small account, about two-three thousand dollars;
- you must be over 18 years old. 
<p>
At the stock exchange, you can trade different instruments, including shares. 
Now let's see what is a share? A share is a unique financial instrument (in general, everything which can be traded on the stock exchange - futures, CFDs, options, shares, bonds - is called a financial instrument). 
Have you ever thought that everything around you, everything you successfully use, your coffee maker, gas station, plane, rented car, food market, pharmacy, etc. - it's all someone’s shares. 
<p>
When you will finish studying you will understand how it works as a trader, you will get a unique opportunity to become a co-owner of the shares of these companies. Also, to get the opportunity to receive a stable additional online income, while being anywhere in the world. 
There are two ways to make money on the stock market: by trading on the increasing price of shares or by trading on lowering them. 
<p>
Let's look at these two ways in more detail. 
Long position - when a trader buys shares and plans to sell it later for a higher price. When a trader pays his money and buys a share, we say that he has a long position. 
If the trader was right, then the share price will go up, and now it costs more than the trader paid for it. In this case, it is said that this is a position in the money, so the trader is already making money on it. 
However, at this moment it is just virtual money. They can disappear as easily as they appeared. The trader at this moment has an Open Position. In order to receive real money, he must close it, so to sell all your shares. 
Long positions are closed by selling shares. The difference between the purchase and sale price is your profit. 
<p>
Short position - trader sells shares first (which he does not have, at the moment), hoping to buy them later for a lower price. 
<p>
In order to sell shares that you don’t have, you must first borrow them from someone. Usually, traders borrow shares from their broker or trading platform they use. It happens automatically, you don’t need to worry about it.
<p>
So, you borrowed shares from your broker and sold them on the stock exchange. At this point, you have a short position. 
You must remember that you borrow the shares, and you are obliged to return them to your broker. In order to do this, you need at some point to buy these shares in the market. 
If you are right and the stock price starts to fall, you can buy shares cheaper than sold. 
The difference between the sale price and the purchase price is your profit. Short positions are closed by buying shares. 
<p>
This is all the information of the first lesson, I hope it was interesting and useful for you. 
In the next lesson, we will get acquainted with one of the most convenient online-portals - finviz.com
<p>
This resource presents the “strongest” filters that can be used for trading on the American stock market, and we will study them. 
See you at the next lesson, you will learn even more interesting and secret trading information. 
<p>
For homework, let's have a feedback session:
You will tell me about yourself (of course, what you want to tell), what led you into trading, what qualities you have for trading in your opinion, and what qualities you lack. 
Which themes from the first lesson cause difficulty, misunderstanding, and questions for you. 
About all this, you can write to me on this email:
abt.company@aol.com
<p>
I will be pleased to get acquainted with the whole group. I am very interested to know why you are here, what are your expectations from the course and to answer all your questions, to clarify difficulties if you have them, and you will be ready for the second lesson. 
<p>
Thank you very much, waiting for your letters. Alex
<p>
Trading for beginners. Basic knowledge. 
LESSON 2. Information: where to get and how to properly search. 
<p>
Hello dear beginners, but in the near future the most successful traders!
It was great to get feedback from you and get to know you better. 
Now I understand, we have very interesting people here!
<p>
It is very great to know that we have so many people of different professions and temperaments, and even better, all of you are united by an interest in trading, with new opportunities and new impressions. 
Together we will go forward and will surely get the best from this course. I am very grateful to you for continuing to learn many new things and not being afraid to get yourself to a new level. 
Good luck! 
<p>
Today we look at one of the most convenient, simple, and free resources for monitoring and searching for good stocks - finviz.com. 
Every trader needs good information, without it, we are blind kittens, and a Finviz can help us to be fully armed. 
First, I propose you to type in your browser (chrome, opera, safari, etc. ) - finviz.com and after this page is loaded, you will see a beautiful and vivid site. 
What information can Finviz give us? Very useful for any trader: stock exchange indices, active stocks, dynamic sector map, search engine (Screener). 
What it is, where to see it, and how to use it, we are now going to learn. 
<p>
At the top of the page, you will see three independent charts - these are the indices of the main exchanges. We examined the topic of stock exchanges during the first lesson. 
Below, under these index charts, the Finviz resource shows two columns of information. The first column is those who are cool today (Top Gainers), and the second is those who are currently managing their companies badly (Top Losers). 
<p>
Image # 1:
<p>
This is very important daily information because many eyes of traders and investors are looking at these stocks. 
<p>
All these stocks are automatically converted from ordinary into active stocks. These stocks get a completely different sales volume for one trading session, much more than they usually have. Therefore, these active stocks become very interesting for traders. 
<p>
For example, below, on image #2, I noted for you an active stock of NVDA from the second column of Finviz, which reported on November 15, 2018, and after a bad report, dropped by $40. 
I think many people that day had a lot of losses. 
We were keeping an eye on this company from the first days of October and, as a result, we made a lot of money in one day. It was the correct, planned, and successful trade.
After 2 years we can see the same NVDA behavior, on September 2nd, 2020, after a bad report, it dropped from $580 to $480.
Screen # 2
<p>
Thanks to the active stocks of the day, all traders can make huge amounts of money.
Traders gain mostly from the daily active stocks.
<p>
From where did the forecast come that NVDA stock will collapse after the report, we will be able to discuss with you in more detail during the following lessons. And now, let's continue to explore the capabilities of the Finviz resource. See image # 3 below.
<p>
In the lower right corner of Finviz, there is an active map of all trading sectors of the exchange, in which you will find all the major US companies, and there are many of them - 7667.
<p>
This convenient and dynamic map constantly changes its color depending on who is leading today: bulls or bears (we will also consider who these "animals" are during the next lessons).
<p>
Since this is a very huge resource, try just to walk around the site, I think it will be interesting for you to touch and feel all these huge capitals of the USA.
<p>
Under the search, in the left corner, you can see this on the screen at number 4, there are many useful buttons:
<p>
Home, News, Screener, Maps, Groups, Portfolio, Insider, Futures, Forex, Crypto.
We will take a closer look at the Screener button.
Why do we need it?
<p>
Because, thanks to this tool, we select stocks for trading using a set of filters.
Let's try doing it right now by clicking the Screener button.
<p>
Image # 4
<p>
After clicking, a tab will open with a minimum set of different search filters.
<p>
Now let's move on to image #5:
<p>
In image #5, we see the minimum set of filters required to search for stocks. This set allows us to select stocks for trading according to the following criteria: country of origin of the company, the market on which it is traded, what the company does, what sector it is in, price and volume.
<p>
Now we are considering the minimum that has opened to us, in fact, there are much more parameters for selecting and searching for stocks, and we will continue to study them in the next lesson.
<p>
As homework, try to find the “ALL” section, see what filters it offers you.
Let your eyes begin to get used to the abundance of information.
<p>
And then, in the next lesson, you'll be ready to start working with these advanced filters and not get lost in the search capabilities.
<p>
For today, perhaps, it’s all.
Watch, read, explore, experiment. Train your brain!
<p>
All your impressions, everything you want to share, I still accept at:
abt.company@aol.com
<p>
We will discuss your difficulties, incomprehensibility, as well as all your questions.
See you in the next lesson! 
Alex.

Lesson 3. Advanced Filters.
<p>
Glad to see everyone in our school! Hello everybody!
After the previous lesson, there were a lot of questions and that's great!
You look, analyze, begin to understand the market - it pleases me endlessly!
I am grateful to you for your activity and diligence.
Indeed, judging by your letters and questions, you are very deep thinking and analyzing persons and this cannot but rejoice!
I think anyone in my position would be happy to have such a team of students. But since it’s me who is lucky to work with you, let's continue further!
<p>
During this lesson, we will look at how to get started with advanced filters for searching for stocks on the resource finviz.com.
<p>
To open the maximum set of filters, you need to find the “ALL” section at the top of the page and click on it. Screen number #1
<p>
After that, you will have access to a complete set of all filters necessary for a trader or investor.
Screen number #2
<p>
Before searching the desired stocks, you will need to mark and activate some filters:
<p>
1. In the Index column, select “S&P 500” - you will see a list of the richest and most "thoroughbred" companies on the market. As a rule, companies from this list have large capitalization, a positive reputation, they trade according to the rules of the market, or at least they try to do so. Also, the S&P 500 companies have a fairly large volume of daily sales, as well as a good daily movement, which makes it possible for a trader to earn money. This is important (the movement of the stock), since a stock that stands still or moves a few cents is considered a "dead stock" and a trader cannot make money on such stock.
<p>
2. Further, in the Country item, select “USA”, since stocks of other countries and other continents may behave inadequately, so you need to be careful with them or have sufficient experience.
<p>
3. After that, in the Price column, select the desired stock price, I recommend looking above $10, but if you are interested in monitoring low-cost stocks, how they behave during the trading session, look, watch and do conclusions. I'm sure you'll see a lot of interesting things.
<p>
4. Go to the ATR (Average True Range) - we select more than $1, this means that the stock moves more than one dollar in one direction or the other during the trading session, which makes it possible for a trader to make good money, we discussed this above, remember the stock movement? Therefore, we choose more than $1.
<p>
5. And finally, go to the section daily volume of sales - “Current Volume” - set from 2 million shares, because with such a sufficiently large volume of shares, a daily level of support and resistance is formed. These are the two most important concepts in trading, we will study them separately, in-depth and in great detail during the next lessons.
<p>
After you set all the above parameters, Finviz will show you 100-150 good stocks.
By further clicking on the ticker (abbreviated name of the company), a new window will open with a stock chart and publicly available information about the company you have selected.
A lot of interesting discoveries await you here, because the information that is in everyone's sight, with the correct analysis, will tell you the future direction of the stock movement.
I will show you the secret places to look to see valuable information (not available to the inexperienced traders) during the following lessons. Screen number #3
<p>
This is all the information of the third lesson, I hope everything was clear for you and you received new, interesting knowledge.
<p>
As homework, I will ask you to work with the filters for selecting stocks, to choose the most interesting ones, in your opinion. Also, I ask you to take screenshots of the two stocks you have chosen and describe (explain) why you liked them and why you chose them.
<p>
I am waiting for your answers, it would be very interesting to see your choice and discuss it with you. I am still waiting for a letter on this email:
abt.company@aol.com
